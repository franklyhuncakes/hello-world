# hello-world
date: April, 2022 goal: Intro. to github!!!

Howdy,
My name is Ajay... I wonder ðŸ¤” how many new cool folks I can meet on github?
Hobbies are:      Mainly keeping up with the football and baseball and PGA scores.
                  Also I enjoy very much keeping up with system updates lol ðŸ˜….
                  Love listening to music and playing music when I can.
Technical Skills: What are those...? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
                  I do like OS stuff, like, running and testing backups and creating
                    interesting VM (virtual machine) images.
                  Networking (e.g., devices, people, etc...)
Ambitions:        I hope to develop some meaningful DB stuff. Oh and to at least appear
                  as cool ðŸ˜Ž, as I know I am, to a few others... lol
Well, that wasn't so difficult. "Whew..." 
Good Fortune and Happy Trails!!! :)
